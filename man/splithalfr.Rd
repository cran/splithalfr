\title{splithalfr: Extensible Bootstrapped Split-Half Reliabilities}
\description{
Calculates scores and estimates bootstrapped split-half reliabilities for reaction time (RT) tasks and questionnaires.
The splithalfr can be extended with custom scoring algorithms for user-provided datasets.
}
\details{
The splithalfr vignettes demonstrate how to write a custom scoring algorithm based on included example scoring algorithms and datasets:

\itemize{
  \item \code{vignette("rapi_sum")} Sum-score for data of the 23-item version of the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (\href{https://research.alcoholstudies.rutgers.edu/rapi}{White & Labouvie, 1989})
  \item \code{vignette("vpt_diff_of_means")} Difference of mean RTs for correct responses, after removing RTs below 200 ms and above 520 ms, on Visual Probe Task data (\href{https://doi.org/10.1080/026999399379050}{Mogg & Bradley, 1999})
  \item \code{vignette("aat_double_diff_of_medians")} Double difference of medians for correct responses on Approach Avoidance Task data (\href{http://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2007.08.010}{Heuer, Rinck, & Becker, 2007})
  \item \code{vignette("iat_dscore_ri")} Improved d-score algorithm for data of an Implicit Association Task that requires a correct response in order to continue to the next trial (\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197}{Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003})
}
}
\section{Validation of algorithms}{

\itemize{
  \item The R script included in each vignette has been validated by comparing the splithalfr score for a single participant with the same score calculated via Excel. The materials for each test can be found in \href{https://github.com/tpronk/splithalfr/tree/master/tests}{the splithalfr GitHub repository}.
  \item The splithalfr splitting algorithm has been validated via a set of simulations that are not included in this package. The R script for these simulations can be found \href{https://github.com/tpronk/splithalfr_simulation}{here}.
