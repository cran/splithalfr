\description{
The Stop Signal Task is a task in which participants responded whether a stimulus was a square or a circle.
On 25% of trials the participant heard a tone that indicated that the participant should withhold their response.
This particular dataset is from the first session of a study that is 
described in detail in \doi{10.1016/j.tate.2019.102887}{Hedge, Powell, and Sumner (2018)}. 
It was graciously provided by \href{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig-Hedge}{Craig Hedge} and can
