\description{
The JASMIN2 AAT was an irrelevant feature task, in which participants were instructed to
approach/avoid left/right rotated stimuli. This particular AAT presented stimuli from a "test"
category, which were math-related pictures, and from a "control" category, which were pictures unrelated
to math. It registered approach responses by participants pressing (and holding) the arrow down key,
while avoid responses were given via the arrow up key. Upon a response, the stimulus zoomed in or
out, until it disappeared from the screen. The first response to a stimulus was logged, as well as the final
response, as defined by the stimulus completely zooming in or out. Upon a correct final response
the next trial started and upon an incorrect final response the current trial was repeated. The first and final
response to each trial was logged. The dataset contains one row per trial.

\details{
\itemize{
  \item UserID. Identifies participants
  \item approach_left. If TRUE, participants were instructed to approach left rotated stimuli. If FALSE, participants were instructed to approach right rotated stimuli.
  \item trial_type. Values: "approach" or "avoid"
  \item cat. Stimulus category: practice, test, or control
  \item stim. Stimulus
  \item response. Initial response; 1 = correct, 2 = incorrect, 3 = timeout (no response in 4000 ms), 4 = invalid key
  \item rt. Response time in milliseconds
  \item sust. Was approach or avoid response sustained until the stimulus was completely zoomed in or out?
  \item final_response. Final response; the response that ended the current trial. Possible values are the same as for response
  \item block. Counts blocks, starting at zero
  \item trial. Counts trials in blocks, starting at zero
  \item attempt. Counts attempts (responses) in trials, starting at zero
  \item block_type. Type of block: "assess1" and "assess2" for assessment trials with salient stimuli
