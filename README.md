# splithalfr: Split-Half Reliabilities
Estimates split-half reliabilities for scoring algorithms of reaction time (RT) tasks and questionnaires. 

## Getting started
We've got six short vignettes to help you get started. You can open a vignette bij running the corresponding code snippets `vignette(...)` in the R console.

* `vignette("rapi_sum")` Sum-score for data of the 23-item version of the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index ([White & Labouvie, 1989](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index4200EN.html))
* `vignette("vpt_diff_of_means")` Difference of mean RTs for correct responses, after removing RTs below 200 ms and above 520 ms, on Visual Probe Task data ([Mogg & Bradley, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1080/026999399379050))
* `vignette("aat_double_diff_of_medians")` Double difference of medians for correct responses on Approach Avoidance Task data ([Heuer, Rinck, & Becker, 2007](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2007.08.010))
* `vignette("iat_dscore_ri")` Improved d-score algorithm for data of an Implicit Association Task that requires a correct response in order to continue to the next trial ([Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197))
* `vignette("sst_ssrti")` Stop-Signal Reaction Time integration method for data of a Stop Signal Task ([Logan, 1981](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/logan/Logan(1981).pdf))
* `vignette("gng_dprime")` D-prime for data of a Go/No Go task ([Miller, 1996](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03205476))

## Splitting techniques
`vignette("splitting_techniques")` The splithalfr supports a variety of techniques for splitting your data. The vignette above illustrates five splitting methods you might encounter in cognitive task literature:
* first-second and odd-even ([Green et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-015-0968-3); [Webb, Shavelson, & Haertel, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-7161(06)26004-8); [Williams & Kaufmann, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.001))
* stratified ([Green et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-015-0968-3))
* permutated/bootstrapped/random sample of split halves ([Parsons, Kruijt, & Fox, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245919879695); [Williams & Kaufmann, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.001))
* Monte Carlo ([Williams & Kaufmann, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.001))

## Validation of split-half estimations
Part of the splithalfr algorithm has been validated via a set of simulations that are not included in this package. The R script for these simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/tpronk/splithalfr_simulation).

## Related packages
These R packages offer bootstrapped split-half reliabilities for specific scoring algorithms and are available via CRAN at the time of this writing:  [multicon](https://cran.r-project.org/package=multicon), [psych](https://cran.r-project.org/package=psych), and [splithalf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=splithalf).
